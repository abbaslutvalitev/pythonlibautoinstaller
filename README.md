I think everyone understands the warning menu
Under Library name: there is an input field. You need to enter the name of the library with which you will conduct actions.Otherwise, this error will occur.

If you do not understand from the video, I will explain in the text. I opened the utility folder and ran just one file. The console opened and the interface itself opened. I entered the library and clicked "Install!"
The installation process began in the terminal. And then to show you I clicked on "Uninstall!".If you uninstall via pip, then you will have an inscription "Proceed Y or N" there, the same everywhere. If you delete Y well, if you change your mind N.
